# vim-daily-local
Simple local tool to display Vim tips and thus support learning and practicing Vim

The basic idea (and the initial list of tips go back to [vimtipsdaily](https://github.com/forkmantis/vimtipsdaily). There the tips are posted daily via Twitter. I liked the idea and the tips, but not the way they are broadcast. So here comes a "local" version of it. It's just a simple HTML-page which renews the tip whenever you reload it. So stricly speaking it's not daily, but can be incorporated in your daily routine.
